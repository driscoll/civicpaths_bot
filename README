Civic Paths Bot
====================================

Simple Python module for creating 
bots that track and RT tweets based 
on keywords/phrases. 

Configuration
====================================

Your bot's configuration is stored
in HISTORY_FILENAME

The first time you run the bot, an 
empty configuration file is created.
You will have to edit this by hand.

The empty config file looks like this:

{
    "BOT_USER_ID": "",
    "KEYWORDS": [], 
    "CONSUMER_KEY": "", 
    "CONSUMER_SECRET": "", 
    "OAUTH_TOKEN": "", 
    "OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET": ""
}

BOT_USER_ID refers to the unique 
numerical ID assigned by Twitter to
each user. If you don't know yours:
* http://www.idfromuser.com

KEYWORDS contains a list of strings 
to search with, e,g. 
["#civicpaths","civic engagement"] 

CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET, 
OAUTH_TOKEN, and OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET
refer to Twitter's OAuth validation
process. Most people reading this
should set up a single-use token:

Typical usage
====================================

The typical() function represents a
simple sequence that you might use in
a cron job.

* Load history
* Search for each keyword
* Process the new tweets
* Send out RTs
* Dump history
* Quit


Note on History 
====================================

Civic Paths Bot was designed for a 
very low traffic situation (1-2 tweets
per day.) The history file will get 
quite large if your search criteria
is more broad.

One work around is to periodically 
archive the history files by hand.

As long as you maintain the values for
lastupdate and since_id, the bot will
avoid duplicating old messages.

An example of a blank history might
be:

{
    "lastupdate": "2011-10-08 14:17:14.114872", 
    "since_id": "122503982349426688",
    "tweets": {}
}


Wishlist
====================================

* Improve history system to handle very large numbers of tweets 
* Setup commandline params
* Respond to DMs, @s, follows
* User whitelist/blacklist?
* Handle Twitter HTTP errors smarter

* Walk new users through the OAUTH process
